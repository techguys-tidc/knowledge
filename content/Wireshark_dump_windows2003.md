:warning: **Note** : use the correct version for each windows version
```
Older versions of Windows which are outside Microsoftâ€™s extended lifecycle support window are no longer supported. It is often difficult or impossible to support these systems due to circumstances beyond our control, such as third party libraries on which we depend or due to necessary features that are only present in newer versions of Windows such as hardened security or memory management.
