:warning: **Note** : use the correct version for each windows version
```
Older versions of Windows which are outside Microsoftâ€™s extended lifecycle support window are no longer supported. It is often difficult or impossible to support these systems due to circumstances beyond our control, such as third party libraries on which we depend or due to necessary features that are only present in newer versions of Windows such as hardened security or memory management.

Wireshark 4.0 was the last release branch to officially support Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012.
Wireshark 3.6 was the last release branch to officially support 32-bit Windows.
Wireshark 3.2 was the last release branch to officially support Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
Wireshark 2.2 was the last release branch to support Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 sans R2
Wireshark 1.12 was the last release branch to support Windows Server 2003.
Wireshark 1.10 was the last release branch to officially support Windows XP.
